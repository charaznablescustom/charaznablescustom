learning web design and js

**here from ponytown? read this before interacting with me:**
- **i only allow [one person](https://github.com/themurlocs) to copy my skins**. any skin that resembles mine but does not have either of our githubs linked is stolen.
- **dont cover me**, i try my best with my skins and i dont like seeing my work dismissed
- i make potentially triggering jokes with my friends, use the ignore function if this bothers you! we try to keep most of this in whispers though
- i hide a lot but will usually only do it if i dont wanna interact with you or if youre racist, anti-semitic, homophobic &c
- your ahegao face and stripper skins arent funny nor are they hot
- mcyt fans and fnf/fnf mod fans please dont interact with me thanks <3
- proship/anti-anti fuck off

interact if you like any of these:
- KING GIZZARD AND THE LIZARD WIZARD PLEASE TALK TO ME ABOUT THEM AND THEIR SIDE PROJECTS (murlocs, pipe-eye, bullant &c)
- other psych rock artists like mgmt, temples, tame impala, and pond
- haunted mound
- no more heroes
- jojos bizarre adventure
